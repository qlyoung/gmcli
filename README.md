gmcli
=====
GroupMe command-line client, with a few novel features.

Mostly wrote this to make it easier to spam some friends, but it's a fully-featured
GroupMe client.

Usage
-----
First you need to obtain an API key from GroupMe. You can get one at
https://dev.groupme.com/ by logging in with your normal GroupMe credentials.
After you've obtained the key, put it in config.yaml as the value for
api-key and you're ready to go.

    $ python3 main.py

Dependencies
------------

    $ pip3 install GroupyAPI emoji requests pyyaml
